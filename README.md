## Effort Management App (EMA)

The effort management app of the state government will be having the repository of tracked citizens and will sub allocate management roles to concerned districts and concerned CHC (usually 9-10 within districts) and PHC (usually 9-10 under 1 CHC). This sub-allotment will be done based on GIS mapping of their administrative units that will be available as a GIS layer. Each PHC will have a set of medical officers that will get cases distributed among them based on phone numbers taken from their HR directory. The concerned Medical Officer (MO) will get a calendar of visits generated for him to visit QC (Quarantined Citizens) and fill a checklist of Home quarantine guidelines along with pictures.
The district and state dashboards should be able to see diagnostics on following and raise alerts for MOs for appropriate cases:

1.Quarantine citizens who have not activated app.
2.Quarantine citizens who have turned off GPS.
3.Quarantine citizens who have not sent dayâ€™s photos.
4.Quarantine citizens who have raised alarm.
5.Quarantine citizens who have gone outside a predetermined radius (2 kms).
6.Quarantine citizens movement map in last 14 days.
7.Quarantine citizens visited by administration (number of visits)
8.Quarantine citizens medically tested and quarantined.
9.Quality of quarantine citizens for each Quarantine in last 24, 72 and lifetime
The tracking should end automatically after a present N days. Each Quarantine citizens tracks should be stored and once any suspected case becomes an actual case, the path history of said person should feed into the general app for backtracking.
